This website was made using Jekyll and is obviously still in construction. I'm checking whether I prefer using Jekyll or having a more homemade solution. I think I'd lean on the latter, but this version is a nice plug-and-play solution.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
